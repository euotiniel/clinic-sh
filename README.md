### Santa Muxima Clinic

Our final project of the discipline of Operating Systems I - Management of a clinic, lol. 

This is a fictional system with educational purposes dedicated to our learning of Shell Script. The idea was to build a system for a clinic that would demonstrate knowledge in the following areas (Linux):

- Basic Linux Commands;
- User and Group Management, permissions;
- File System: mounting, unmounting and directory structures;
- File system cleanup;
- Shell Scripting;
- Network environment configuration, log files;
